### [Demo](https://elm-spa-spa-example.netlify.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **elm-spa** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **elm-spa** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
